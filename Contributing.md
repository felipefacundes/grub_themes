# üëç Contributing

Contributions are highly encouraged, whether they are themes you've designed yourself or unique themes you've found online. To contribute, simply open a Pull Request and add your theme to the table, including a preview image and a link to the hosting page.  

If you're unsure how to proceed, you can create an Issue instead. Include the link and a preview image, and I'll ensure it's added when I have the opportunity.

Please note the following guidelines for contributions:

- **Themes must feature substantial customization:** Submissions that only include the default GRUB menu with a new background will not be accepted. At a minimum, ensure your theme includes a custom background, menu selector, and distinctive text elements.

- **Forks of existing themes should be significantly modified:** Modifying an existing theme can be a great way to learn GRUB theming, but contributions should demonstrate enough changes to make them distinct from the original. This collection aims to showcase unique designs, which becomes difficult if minor edits dominate. For inspiration, compare the CRT-Amber theme to the Fallout theme it originated from‚Äîthis level of differentiation is expected.

- **Themes must be distinct from others already included:** Even fully custom themes should avoid excessive similarity to existing ones. However, if your design offers a noticeable improvement in quality over a similar theme, it may be considered as a replacement.

- **Avoid "Waifu" themes:** While anime-inspired themes are acceptable, designs that primarily rely on generic renders of anime characters won't be added. This guideline ensures a higher standard of creativity, as similar themes are already overrepresented on platforms like Pling. Themes can be anime-related but must focus on more than just character cutouts and flashy colors.

- **SFW (Safe for Work) content only:** This should go without saying, but submissions must be appropriate for all audiences. Let‚Äôs keep things professional! üò≥  

Your efforts to contribute are greatly appreciated, and I look forward to seeing your creative designs!
